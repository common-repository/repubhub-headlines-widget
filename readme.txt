Display trending headlines from world-class publications. Headlines link to the full article, automatically republished by the plugin on your own site.

== Description ==

Display trending headlines from world-class publications and websites in a widget. Headlines update automatically and link to full articles on your own site, displayed on a hosting page generated by the widget, so readers stay engaged on your site—not redirected elsewhere.  You get new page views and new ad impressions.

You select which publications, which category of articles, and how many headlines to display.  Editors and admins have convenient curation tools in their view of the widget that are invisible to your readers. 

Articles are syndicated for free from participating publishers because ads are inserted within the article iframe to compensate the content providers and iCopyright.  You monetize the content with your usual ads surrounding the iframe.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

Q: Can I have more than one widget on my site?
A: Yes. You can have as many as you’d like. 

Q:  How do I decide if I want the iCopyright Toolbar plugin or the repubHub Headlines Widget plugin?
A:  The repubHub Headlines Widget is designed for sites that want to add trending news that updates automatically based on parameters you set. No ongoing editorial effort or curation is required, but easy-to-use tools allow the editor to curate whenever desired. 

The iCopyright Toolbar plugin includes this automated widget plus three additional feature sets.  First, it provides editors with a portal where they can search for individual articles relevant to their readers and republish them on their site with one click.  Second, it allows editors to deploy a licensing toolbar atop their original articles so readers can instantly obtain a variety of republishing rights to their content.  Third, it allows sites to automatically feed their original content into our content syndication system (see www.repubhub.com), monetizing it and making it available for other sites to republish.  


Q: I already have the iCopyright Toolbar plugin (recently renamed iCopyright Republishing Suite) installed on my site, which gives me access to repubHub’s syndication portal. Do I need to add this plugin to get the headline widget?
A:  If you have the latest version of the iCopyright Toolbar plugin (Version 3.0 or higher, also called iCopyright Republishing Suite), the repubHub Headline Widget is already included in your Available Widgets, so you don’t need to install this stand-alone version of the repubHub Headline Widget.  If you have an older version, simply update it and use the repubHub Headlines widget there rather than adding this plugin.

Q:  I have excluded a certain publication from my headline widget using the curation tools on the widget itself, and now I regret that decision.  Can I get that publication’s headlines back into my widget?
A:  Yes. Go to Appearance/Widgets and open the repubHub Headlines Widget in your sidebar where you’ll find a list of any publications you have excluded. Just click on the X to remove it from the list.

Q:  When a widget headline is clicked, the reader is taken to a version of the article on repubHub rather than my own site.  What happened?  How do I fix this?
A:  You probably inadvertently deleted the page that hosts the widget article, which is automatically created by the plugin when the widget is created.  To fix this, simply delete the existing widget and create a new one.  

Q:  I have more questions.  How can I get answers?
A:  Email support@icopyright.com with your questions.  Be as specific as you can and provide screenshots that might help us answer your questions.

== Screenshots ==

1. After installing the plugin, the repubHub Headlines Widget appears on your Widgets page.  Drag and drop it to the sidebar and customize it as you wish.
2. Your widget will automatically adapt to your site’s theme and updates continually with trending news that matches the criteria you have established in the widget settings.  The widget on the left shows how a widget appears to your site visitors.  Note that your view of the widget, shown on the right, includes curation tools that allow you to:
   * Publish any of the articles to your site more prominently and permanently as its own Post rather than on the widget’s shared hosting page
   * Remove any specific article (a new trending article will replace it, keeping your widget filled)
   * Exclude any specific source permanently.
